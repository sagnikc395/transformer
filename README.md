## transformer

My implementation of the transformer architecture,
after reading Attention is All You Need paper.

### Structure:

```
.
├── README.md
├── requirements.txt
├── ruff.toml
└── src
    ├── model.py
    └── train.py

2 directories, 5 files
```

- src/model.py 
  has our transformer model.
- src/train.py 
  has out training model with tokenizing the dataset.
- ruff.toml 
  has out python config
